<h2>Why I am interested in a Koala?</h2>
<ol>
    <p>They have so much free time to just sit and chill<br />
    They are slow but somewhat cool<br />
    They also seem lazy<br /></p>

<h3>Out of all animals in the world, why a Koala?</h3>
<body>
    <p>If I am to be honest, I literally have no favorite animal but, 
        the only one I thought in my head that was somewhat interesting was the Koala.
